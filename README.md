# Changed Package Name to cordova-plugin-twiliovoicesdk
Note - as of August 21, 2018, this NPM package name will match the Cordova Plugin id.

# Requires AndroidX (Android only)
Note - as of January 15, 2021, this requires AndroidX support, as well as Cordova Android 9 or above. You also need to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), and include a `google-services.json` file in your `platforms/android/app` directory

In your Cordova project's `config.xml`, add these options:

```xml
<preference name="AndroidXEnabled" value="true" />
<preference name="GradlePluginGoogleServicesEnabled" value="true"/>
```

If you don't add that, you will see this error:

```
This project uses AndroidX dependencies, but the 'android.useAndroidX' property is not enabled. Set this property to true in the gradle.properties file and retry.
```

## Android X Required

If you use any Android plugins that do not support AndroidX, please add this plugin to your project:
